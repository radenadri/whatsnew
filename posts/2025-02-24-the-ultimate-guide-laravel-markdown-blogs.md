## Introduction

Laravel is a powerful PHP framework that makes web development a joy. Combined with Markdown for content creation, you get a flexible, maintainable, and developer-friendly blogging platform.

## Basic Formatting

Markdown supports various text formatting options:

### Code Blocks

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Support\Str;
use Spatie\LaravelMarkdown\MarkdownRenderer;

class Post
{
    public string $slug;
    public string $title;
    public string $content;
    
    public static function fromFile(string $filename): ?self
    {
        $post = new self();
        return $post;
    }
}
```

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const blogPosts = document.querySelectorAll('.blog-post');
    
    blogPosts.forEach(post => {
        post.addEventListener('click', () => {
            console.log('Post clicked:', post.dataset.title);
        });
